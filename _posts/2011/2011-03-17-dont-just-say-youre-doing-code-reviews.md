I keep hearing how wonderful code reviews are to help improve the quality of code.  There is a lot of information about how code reviews can improve code design, reduce defects, and share knowledge.  I have participated in a number of code reviews, and I can definitely say they have the potential to be a powerful tool.  My problem with code reviews is not the concept, but the follow through.

I think it can be really easy to implement a code review process, but ultimately it takes discipline to make the process effective.  Like any good idea it is all about execution.  I believe there is a reason some are seeing true benefits from a code review while others are seeing very little in return.

Below are two lists of responsibilities for both the developer and the reviewer.  Of course this is not a list to end all lists, but it is definitely a sound starting point.  If your team can be disciplined to execute on these responsibilities you should start seeing consistent return from your code reviews.

Responsibilities of the reviewer:
<ol>
	<li>evaluate the code and not the developer</li>
	<li>understand the requirements and intent</li>
	<li>ask to see the tests</li>
	<li>review the design</li>
	<li>collaborate to find ways to make the code better</li>
	<li>be engaged</li>
</ol>
Responsibilities of the developer:
<ol>
	<li>Do not take feedback personally and be prepared to collaborate</li>
	<li>reduce the size and scope of the review by having frequent reviews</li>
	<li>communicate the requirements and intent</li>
	<li>being willing to talk about the “what” and the “why” you did something</li>
	<li>be willing to make adjustments based on feedback</li>
	<li>be engaged</li>
</ol>
